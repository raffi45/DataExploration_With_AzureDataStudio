# DataExploration With Azure Data Studio

## project Overview

This project explores the Northwind database to extract insights into supplier performance, product sales, annual revenue, and geographic distribution of orders. The analysis covers six areas: calculating total quantities sold by each supplier, identifying best-selling product categories, measuring annual income, determining total orders by country, calculating revenue from each product category for a specific period, and summarizing revenue by customer country for the same period. Data will be sourced from the Suppliers, Products, Categories, Orders, Order Details, and Customers tables. Deliverables include a detailed report, visualizations, and SQL scripts used for analysis.

## Query

In this project, several SQL query methods are employed to explore data from the Northwind database. Here's a brief explanation of each query method used, emphasizing their usage of aggregate functions:
- Join: This method is used to combine data from multiple tables based on matching columns between them. It allows the merging of related data for further analysis, such as connecting product information with order details.
- Group By: This method is used to group rows of data based on specific values from one or more columns. It's useful when calculating aggregates like totals or averages for each group of data created.
- Order By: This method is used to sort the query results based on the values of one or more columns. It helps in presenting results in a structured manner and can facilitate understanding of the displayed data.
- Date Functions: Various date functions, such as extracting specific parts of a date (e.g., month, day) or performing date arithmetic, can be used to manipulate and analyze date-related data effectively. These functions help in calculating metrics like monthly revenue or year-over-year growth.
